## ELI12 - Lesson 3

1. `for`

You have a list of items to run through. This can be a list of names, each of which you want to capitalize (the first letter; you were lazy when you typed them in at first...). With a `for` loop, you can instruct a program to execute the same task (capitalizing the first letter) on all the items in the list, but without having to write a separate function for each item. This is great because it saves you a lot of time.

2. `&&`

You need to verify that two statements are true: Use `&&` to check this. For example, a condition where this could apply is: Only enter the club if you AND your friends all have enough money to pay cover.

3. `||`

You need to verify that one of two statements is true: Use `||` to check this. For example, if you have two cars and just one of them is working, you can drive to the office. Check if CarA OR CarB starts...

4. `!`

You have a statement you need to verify, but you want to make sure that the two halves of the statement are NOT EQUAL to each other. One example: You need to create a password-checker to help make sure your users use strong passwords. You can check whatever string they input into the password field for length, and reject it if the password length IS NOT Greater-Than 7 characters.

5. Arrays

An array is a 'bucket' in which to store data of the same type. Instead of listing out each of your friends' names, and assigning each of them a variable (as in Friend1 = Mary; Friend2 = Ben, etc.), you can simply create an Array and lists all of their names together: `let friendsNames = ["Mary", "Ben", "Sue", "{etc.}"];`.

### Final Checks - Lesson 3

From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm run test:JSII` to run the automated tests.
You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
